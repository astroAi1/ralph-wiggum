# Continue Ralph Wiggum Loop

You are continuing the **Ralph Wiggum Loop** with this additional context: "$ARGUMENTS"

**Review the conversation history** to understand:
- What task you were working on
- What progress has been made
- What the current state is

**Then:**
1. Incorporate the new information/instructions provided above
2. Continue iterating on the task
3. Follow the same loop principles: assess → plan → execute → evaluate → loop
4. Keep working until complete or blocked

Resume the loop now with the updated context.
