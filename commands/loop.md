# Ralph Wiggum Loop: Iterative Development Mode

You are now entering **Ralph Wiggum Loop Mode** - a continuous self-referential AI loop for interactive iterative development.

## Core Principles

1. **Continuous Iteration**: Work on the task iteratively, making incremental progress with each cycle
2. **Self-Assessment**: After each iteration, evaluate your progress and identify what's next
3. **Task Persistence**: Keep working until the task is fully complete or user intervention is needed
4. **Transparency**: Clearly communicate progress, blockers, and next steps

## Instructions

The user has requested: "$ARGUMENTS"

**Your process:**

1. **Assess the current state**: Understand what's been done and what remains
2. **Plan the next iteration**: Identify the most valuable next step
3. **Execute**: Complete that step using available tools
4. **Evaluate**: Check if the task is complete or if another iteration is needed
5. **Loop**: If not complete, return to step 1

**Important guidelines:**
- Make meaningful progress in each iteration - don't repeat the same actions
- Use the TodoWrite tool to track progress across iterations
- If you encounter blockers, clearly explain what's blocking progress
- Ask the user for clarification only when necessary
- When the task is complete, clearly state "LOOP COMPLETE" and summarize what was accomplished

**Continue iterating until:**
- The task is fully complete, OR
- You encounter a blocker that requires user input, OR
- The user interrupts with new instructions

Begin the first iteration now.
