# Agent Knowledge Base

This file contains reusable patterns, gotchas, and cross-cutting concerns discovered during development.

## Guidelines

### ✅ Add Here
- "When modifying X, also update Y"
- "This module uses pattern Z"
- "Tests require dev server running"
- Cross-file dependencies
- Non-obvious patterns
- Setup requirements

### ❌ Don't Add
- Story-specific details (use progress.txt)
- Temporary notes
- Info already in progress.txt
- One-time decisions

**Think:** "Will this help the next agent working on ANY story?"
